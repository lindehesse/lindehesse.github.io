Hi there! I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford in the department of Engineering. I am working in the [Namburete group](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~some2959/index.html) where we develop methods to automatically analyse the fetal brain in 3D ultrasound scans. In my project, I am trying to use computer vision to look at differences in brain maturation between healthy fetusses and fetusses with congenital heart defects. 

I am always excited to talk about my research and get in touch with new people, so feel free to send me a message!
