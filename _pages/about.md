Hi there! I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford in the department of Engineering. I am working in the [Oxford Machine Learning in NeuroImaging Lab] (https://omni.cs.ox.ac.uk/) where we develop methods to automatically analyse the fetal brain in 3D ultrasound scans. In my project, I am trying to use computer vision to look at differences in brain maturation between healthy fetuses and fetuses with congenital heart defects. 

I am always excited to talk about my research and get in touch with new people, so feel free to send me a message!

I am also President of the Oxford Women in Computer Science Society, and am passionate about motivating more women to persue computer science careers! To learn more about our society have a look at our [website] (https://oxwocs.squarespace.com/). We are always looking for more people to join, so don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in becoming involved in our society.
